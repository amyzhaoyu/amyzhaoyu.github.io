I am Senior Director of Product Strategy and Data Science in the [Audience Science](https://science.viacom.com) team at Viacom, where I lead the design and development of visual data science platforms that enable data-driven decisions across all of Viacom’s portfolio brands.

I graduated from the [Jerome Fisher Program in Management and Technology](http://www.upenn.edu/fisher/) at the University of Pennsylvania, receiving undergraduate degrees in Computer Science and Economics with concentrations in Finance and Operations and Information Management.

My research interests focus on utilizing digital data to create visual platforms for understanding social phenomena and informing decisions that affect innovation, business, and public policy.
